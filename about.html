          Hi, I’m Marco — a researcher currently based at Yale University. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics, eventually leading me into the fascinating world of bioinformatics, ecology, and evolutionary biology. If you're curious about my scientific work, feel free to explore my research on 
          <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GHYtgvkAAAAJ&hl=it" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond science, I’m passionate about many things — especially sports, nature, and photography. My love for photography started early, with a simple Olympia compact camera I used as a child. Over the years, my curiosity and admiration for DSLR photography grew, and in 2021, I finally made the leap and began shooting with one myself.

          That decision was more than technical. I took that step in memory of a dear friend who had a passion for portrait photography with her DSLR. This journey, and much of my work, is dedicated to her.
